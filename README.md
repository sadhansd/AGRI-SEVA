# AGRI-SEVA

We use Arduino sensors to monitor the growth of crops and analyze the weather
conditions and soil quality.
we developed a mobile app using MIT App Inventor 2 to visualize the results from the sensors
▫ Farmers can use their smartphones to monitor their equipment,
crops, and livestock remotely and obtain stats on their livestock feeding and
produce.
▫ Sensors placed in fields allow farmers to obtain detailed information about the acidity
and soil temperature. They can also access climate forecasts to
predict weather patterns in the coming days and weeks.
